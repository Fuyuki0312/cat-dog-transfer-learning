## Cat vs Dog Classification with Transfer Learning
Image classification using ResNet18 pretrained on ImageNet, demonstrating transfer learning and inference pipeline with PyTorch.


## Project Overview
Task: Image Classification (Cat vs Dog)
Model: ResNet18 (pretrained on ImageNet)
Framework: PyTorch
Technique: Transfer Learning (frozen backbone + custom classifier)


## Dataset
The dataset is not included due to size limitations.

Structure expected:
CatVsDog/
├─ cat/
├─ dog/


## Inference
You may use: Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset or any custom cat/dog image dataset.
Pretrained model weights (.pth) are not included in this repository due to file size limits.
