## Handwritten Numerical Digit Classification
Image classification using Controvolutional Neural Network, demonstrating inference pipeline with PyTorch.


## Project Overview
- Task: Image Classification (from 0 to 9)
- Model: Controvolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Framework: PyTorch


## Dataset
- The dataset is not included due to size limitations.

- Structure expected:
- numbers/
- ├─ 0/
- ├─ 1/
- ├─ 2/
- ├─ ...
- ├─ 9/


## Inference
- You may use: Kaggle Handwritten Number Digit dataset or any custom handwritten number image dataset.


## Others
- This project was built in 1/2026 as part of my journey to become an AI Engineer.
